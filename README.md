**See** [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) for background

## Steps:
1. Ensure that you have [npm, nodejs](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node),
[pulp](https://github.com/bodil/pulp#installation) and [PureScript](purescript installation) installed:

2. install the project's dependencies:
```sh
npm run install
```
3.  build and run the problems:
```sh
npm run start
```

If you want to run the tests:
```sh
npm run test
```
**Note:** Some of the solutions to the problems take 15 seconds or more, so be patient!
